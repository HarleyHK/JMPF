# JMPF
Joint Maximum Purity Forest

This is the project code (C++) for the paper: Joint Maximum Purity Forest with Application to Image Super-Resolution 

This part is the C++ code only for the classification and regression tasks. The code for JMPF scheme based image super-resolution part has been merged into my FARF project.

We will release the code when the paper "Joint Maximum Purity Forest with Application to Image Super-Resolution" is accepted.
